# AI-For-Password-Strength-Analysis
This project utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for sequence prediction tasks. LSTMs have been widely used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including text generation and sequence classification. The model is trained on leaked password datasets.
